# cortex

Cortex is a Rust crate providing interactibility with a simple interpreted programming language called Cortex. This is not intended to be a standalone language, but one that works with Rust to give basic scripting functionality. It is easy to inject Cortex modules/structs/functions into the interpreter, to easily write Cortex code that calls back the source Rust code.

â€¼ NOTE: This is a very unstable package! This tool is in the early stages of development, and breaking changes may be released. The goal is to allow for backwards compatibility at all time, but breaking changes may be unavoidable!

(I created this crate for personal use. At the moment, it has not been tested very thoroughly and is likely very buggy. I am aware that it is very incomplete; there is a list of planned features to make it more usable)

See LANGDOCS.md for documentation on the Cortex language itself.
